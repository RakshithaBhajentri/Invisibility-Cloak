# 🧥 Invisibility Cloak using OpenCV

Simulates the effect of invisibility by detecting a colored cloak (e.g., red) and replacing it with the background in real-time video using Python and OpenCV.

## 🚀 How It Works

- Captures the static background before the subject enters the frame.
- Detects cloak color using HSV color masking.
- Replaces the detected cloak region with the background frame, creating the illusion of invisibility.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python  
- OpenCV
